Then we can use this to start building some reusable pieces:

- name service
- custom load-balancing
- custom publish-subscribe
- stateful publish-subscribe
- reliable request-reply
- logging device
- reactor (Matt Weinstein's)


+++ Presence Detection

- peers come and go
- if we want to route to them explicitly, we need to know if they are present
- heartbeating, liveness, etc.
- fresh data, failover, etc.
- purging old identities from routing tables
- example of eight robots and console
- robots come and go...


+++ A Service-Oriented Queue Device

- how to route to workers based on service names
- kind of like custom pubsub but with answers going back to clients


+++ A ZeroMQ Name Service

- name service
    translate logical name into connect or bind string
    service runs locally, connect via ipc://zns
    gets name updates asynchronously from central server
    also local zns lookup file
    using zpl syntax
    pubsub state / refresh example

how to map names?
    - XXX -> tcp://lo:5050 if I'm on server 1
    - XXX -> tcp://somename:5050
    -> does ZMQ do host lookup?  Doesn't seem like it...
    -> resolve host...







+++ Generating Identities

-> need zfl here

- generic LRU device
    - accept input from REQs
    - load balance to bunch of mamas

lrudevice.c
    - imitates a queue device except...



+++ Setting Queue Limits

- setting queue limits prevents nodes from overflowing memory
- by default 0MQ does not set any limits
- example of application that will overflow memory
    - publish to subscribe socket but don't read
- now fix this by setting queue limit, ZMQ_HWM
- actual behaviour with automagic LWM
- how this works on different socket types
    - 'exception' on each socket type, from man page
- adding capacity for disk offload, ZMQ_SWAP
- creating persistent queues using identity
    - example of HWM 1 plus massive SWAP


+++ Reliable Request-Reply

We'll create a reliable request-reply application that uses XREQ and XREP and a simple resend mechanism.  When this works between two peers we'll show how it scales across a request-reply broker to effectively create edge-to-edge reliability.  We'll also open up the message format for request-reply and explore identities in horrible detail.

+++ Configuration Distribution

We'll look at how to dynamically configure a network of devices using a central configuration broker.

+++ Logging Subsystem

many applications
many subscribers
broker in the middle
persistent logfiles
replay via subscribe socket


+++ Stateful Publish-Subscribe

We'll look at the common question of getting a consistent state across a set of subscribers that come and go at any time.  We will build a simple distributed cache:

* We have a set of peers that each hold a copy of the cache
* Any peer can update its copy of the cache at any time
* Updates are published to all other peers
* A peer can join the network at any time, and get the cache state

I'll leave the design for later.  We'll need a forwarder to act as stable location in the network.  Should be fun!

+++ Failover and Recovery

We'll look at how to handle crashes in a distributed architecture.  For each pattern there is an ideal architecture, and we'll explore each of these with worked examples.

+++ Encrypted Publish-Subscribe

We'll look at how to secure pubsub data against snooping.  The actual technique involves out-of-band exchange of keys, symmetric encryption, and a broker that helps the thing along.  Hopefully all fairly easy to make, as usual, using 0MQ.

+++ Building a Multicast Bus

We'll now look at how the pgm: and epgm: protocols work.  With pgm:, the network switch basically acts as a hardware FORWARDER device.

+++ A Clock Device

We'll look at various ways of building a timer into a network.   A clock device sends out a signal (a message) at more or less precise intervals so that other nodes can use these signals for internal timing.

+++ A Logging Device

We'll look at a device that acts as a remote logger.

+++ Building Bridges

zmq_poll(3) lets you mix ZMQ sockets and native system sockets, which is very useful if you have to resort to actual TCP for something, e.g. bridging an existing TCP protocol with 0MQ.  We'll build a couple of bridges.

+++ Writing a Reactor

In this section we'll build a simple reactor framework that turns the zmq_poll(3) function inside out into an event-driven framework.

+++ Exotic Devices

Now we'll use the reactor to build some exotic devices.  It should be much easier and readable than using zmq_poll.

+++ Serializing Data

Examples of using Protocol Buffers and other options.

- tcp://ipaddress:port
 - bind to address:port
 - bind to *:5555
 - localhost
  - also bind to interface: lo:port, eth1:port, etc.
  - Linux: eth1, eth2, eth3
  - Mac OS X: en1, en2, en3
  - Solaris: e1000g, etc.
 - connect to remote address: host:port

- pgm://address;multicastgroup:port
 - address can be interface name
 - requires decent hardware support
 - means enterprise level switches with IGNP snooping
 - some routers also support PGM
 - runs over IP, requires root privileges
 - more standard
 - rate-limited protocol, sender must define bandwidth
 - pgm is currently broken

- epgm://address;multicastgroup:port
 - encapsulated in UDP packets
 - requires decent hardware support
 - does not require root access
 - non-standard to pgm

- add peer example
   - exclusive lock on peer
   - for owning other party
   - solve reverse connection
 - e.g. to cross firewall
 - you need to add a bind to allow the client to accept a connection
 - could be usecase for EXCLUSIVE socket

XREQ is like PUSH+PULL, XREP is like PUSH+PULL+routing

I highly recommend that you try out the simpler topology and *verifying* that 0mq cannot keep up with your message rates when publishing all data to all clients. With smart topics the client can reject the data *very* fast. A 1 GB or 10 Gb switched network can also move quite a bit of data without a lot of blocking behavior in the hardware too. You may be able to save yourself a lot of unnecessary work, so just try it.

- how to send multipart job and execute / cancel



* Client-server data distribution (like custom pubsub), with some restrictions.


Either of the two client socket types send requests and replies as a multipart message with two parts.  The first part is a unique UUID, that identifies the client.  The second is the actual message blob.  The ZMQ_XREP socket uses the identity to know what ØMQ connection to send the message to.

What this means... take deep breath... is that you can use ZMQ_XREQ and ZMQ_XREP to build servers that do authentication and arbitrary routing.  Don't like the existing topic pubsub?  You can build your own.  Here's how to build an authenticated pubsub server:

* Client creates ZMQ_XREQ sends its authentication credentials and subscription pattern as a request.
* Service reads credentials, authenticates them, and if they are OK, stores the client identity in a table of "authorized identities".  This is in effect treating an identity as an abstracted connection.
* Service builds routing tables using subscription pattern, so that any new message can be routed to a set of identities.
* Service does separate zmq_send() to its ZMQ_XREP socket for each matching subscriber, each time specifying the correct identity.
* Service maintains its table of identities periodically to remove old identities.
* Client periodically resends its credentials ("keep-alive"), which server handles by reading on the socket.

It is not trivial, and should maybe sit in the "Advanced Concepts" section, but this use case is one that so many new users ask about that it's good to know at least that ØMQ handles it.


Here is, I think, how to build an authenticated pubsub service using ØMQ.  The design handles authentication, arbitrary routing criteria, and flushing of dead client connections.

You will use ZMQ_XREQ at the client side and ZMQ_XREP at the service side.  There is a simple protocol between client and server that is loosely modelled on HTTP:

* Client sends messages containing: identity (ØMQ adds this automatically), authentication credentials, and subscription criteria.
* Server sends messages containing: identity (automatic), error/success code, and content.

The server has two main data structures:

* A connection table that stores authenticated identities and timestamps.  Each identity corresponds to a client connection.
* A routing table that maps message keys (e.g. topic value) to identities.  There are techniques for doing [http://www.zeromq.org/whitepapers:message-matching high speed message matching].

The client has a single thread that polls on its ZMQ_XREQ socket.  At regular time intervals it (re)sends its authentication and subscription message.  This acts as a keep-alive.

The server has a two threads, one that polls on its ZMQ_XREP socket and one that receives outgoing messages and passes them to the polling thread via inproc sockets.  The polling thread processes any incoming client requests and updates its data structures.  It processes any outgoing messages by looking up the message key in its routing table and then sending the message (one to one) to all matching identities.  As it does this it deletes any expired identities.

That's it.  Sorry if I got some things wrong here, it's theory and not based on running code.

- setsockopt validation
 - identities don't start with zero byte
 - integer values are not negative

- fixes to documentation
 - REP sockets can't drop data on HWM because they are lock-step
 - HWM says n/a for PULL and for SUB, which is wrong
