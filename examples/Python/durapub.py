No-one has translated the durapub example into Python yet.  Be the first to create
durapub in Python and get one free Internet!  If you're the author of the Python
binding, this is a great way to get people to use 0MQ in Python.

To submit a new translation email it to zeromq-dev@lists.zeromq.org.  Please:

* Stick to identical functionality and naming used in examples so that readers
  can easily compare languages.
* You MUST place your name as author in the examples so readers can contact you.
* You MUST state in the email that you license your code under the MIT/X11
  license.
