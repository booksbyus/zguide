No-one has translated the flserver1 example into Ruby yet.  Be the first to create
flserver1 in Ruby and get one free Internet!  If you're the author of the Ruby
binding, this is a great way to get people to use 0MQ in Ruby.

To submit a new translation email it to zeromq-dev@lists.zeromq.org.  Please:

* Stick to identical functionality and naming used in examples so that readers
  can easily compare languages.
* You MUST place your name as author in the examples so readers can contact you.
* You MUST state in the email that you license your code under the MIT/X11
  license.
